# Ten simple rules for better figures

-----

1. **Know your audience**: a figure should be tailored to your audience and will likely be presented differently to groups including peers, students or the general public.
2. **Identify your message** before developing the figure. A figure is a quick way to introduce facts, or a result too complex to explain only with words.
3. **Adapt the figure to the support medium**: the reader of a journal article has time & the ability to zoom on a figure vs a conference attendee has limited time & the presentation is at a distance.
4. **Captions are not optional**: they explain how to read the figure and provide additional clarification for what cannot be graphically represented.
5. **Do not trust the (software) defaults**: manual tuning of software settings will be needed for a salient message.
6. **Use colour effectively**: Use contrasting colours, avoid too many and only use colours where necessary. *(You might need to pay extra!)*
7. **Do not mislead the reader**: objective, simple plots are best.  Use labels, titles and the full range of values where relevant.
8. **Avoid “Chart junk”**: unnecessary visual elements found in a figure that do not improve the message, such as gridlines, too many colours or labels.
9. **Message beats beauty**: find standards in your research domain, scan literature for good visualization methods to use.
10. **Get the right tool**: there is generally a dedicated tool that will do what you're trying to achieve; we will explore some of these.
