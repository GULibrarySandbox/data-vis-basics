### About the data

The dataset used in this workshop is adapted from [Crash data from Queensland roads](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/crash-data-from-queensland-roads), © 2019 The State of Queensland, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence, [CC BY 4.0.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  It was downloaded from the Queensland Government’s [open data portal](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/).

The original dataset presents 17 years of traffic accidents, their location, type of accident, level of injury, and other features, with over 300,000 observations. 

The  data used in these lessons is a smaller, four-year subset and has had changes made for training purposes.
