The interactive reader in the centre of the screen shows the original source materials with individual terms in different colours.
To explore individual terms, click on a term in the reader and see counts and usage of the term in the Contexts box.  
The summary box displays the number of documents being examined, the total word count, unique words, vocab density, average words per sentence and a list of most frequent words in the corpus.

## Activities - Export and Cite your data
The key feature of Voyant is to be able to quickly create visual data, and then the capacity to choose your own visualisation and export the image for further use. 

In this set of activitis we will look at the different types of resources to upload and how to change the visualisations. 

Part 1 - Step 1 

Upload a variety of documents to Voyant

In the lesson we uploaded URLs, PDFS and text to the tool, now try adding both text and a URL to the 'Add Texts' box
does the tool read both elements? 
Step 2

Upload saved PDFs -  using the upload tab, upload multiple PDF documents 
notice how the reader separates the individual articles in the reader by colour
in document, click on a term, notice how the trends map and contexts box change
find your key themes in the text and to track how these terms are used in the text and the contexts. 

Part  2

with your data set, change the visualisation; using the corpus tools menu change the visualisation to 'Steam graph'
now export this using the export visualisation function, export the graph as an SNG, copy the visualisation and paste the image into a word doc
finally, again using the export function, export the bibliographic reference.
