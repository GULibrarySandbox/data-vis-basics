# Create a publication quality image

------

### Image formats

Some publishers require that you submit images from a select range of formats only. For example, instructions from Wiley include:
- Use the following standard image formats: `BMP`, `JPG`, `JPEG`, `TIF`, `WMF`, or `EPS`.

In this group, the first four are `Raster` formats, while the last two are `Vector` formats. When saving an image you should choose a `Raster` format wherever possible as Raster images are more flexible and resizable without loss. Make sure to refer to the journal’s style guide for preferred formats.

### Image resolution

In addition, manuscripts or journals require images with high resolution, nominally `300 ppi` (pixels per inch).

Using Cut and Paste from Excel to Word results in a poor-quality image (72-96 ppi), often with bad pixellation particularly when resizing the image.

There are some things you can do to improve the quality of images in your document.

### Creating suitable images

The best way to create a quality graphic is to use a graphic editor. Below is a list of popular editors.

- *Photoshop* : (*staff only*) part of Adobe Creative Cloud suite of programs 
- *GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)* [https://www.gimp.org/](https://www.gimp.org/) : open source (free) (GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows and other operating systems)
- *PhotoPad* [https://www.nchsoftware.com/photoeditor/](https://www.nchsoftware.com/photoeditor/) : free for non commercial users (Windows)
- *Preview* (Mac OS)

1. Click the `Start` button on your computer.
2. If you see the `Adobe Creative Cloud` shortcut, click on it to install `Photoshop CC`. (You may like to explore some of the other available applications later.)
OR
3. If you don’t see Adobe Creative Cloud in your Start menu, go to Griffith’s `Adobe Product Access` web page:
  - [https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/computing/software/self-help-and-support/general-information/adobe-licensing-changes](

4. Follow the instructions to download and install the software.{% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Activity - Accessing Photoshop (staff)" text=text %}

Below are activities to convert your chart using different software.  Choose and install software from the list above and follow the relevant software instructions below.

{% capture text %}
1.	Generate your chart in Excel.
2.	Select the chart and copy it to the clipboard (Copy or `<Ctrl>+<C>`).
3.	Open PhotoShop CC.
4.	In the Welcome screen, click on `Create New…`.  (If PhotoShop is already open, click on `File` then `New`.)
5.	In the `New Document` dialog box, you’ll see that the option `Clipboard` is already selected.  (If it’s not, then you don’t have anything on the Clipboard – you’ll need to copy your chart again.)
6.	On the right-hand side, change the resolution to `300 pixels/inch` then click the `Create` button.  A canvas has been created that is the correct size for your chart.
7.	Click `Edit`, then `Paste` (or press `<Ctrl>+<V>`) to paste the chart onto the canvas.
8.	Click `File`, then `Save As…` to save your edited image in the format specified by the journal’s style guide and in the appropriate location.{% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Activity - Create image using PhotoShop CC" text=text %}
 
{% capture text %}
1.	Once downloaded and installed, open GIMP and click on `File` on the toolbar, then click on `Open` and browse to locate the image to be resized.
2.	With the image open, click on `Image` on the toolbar, then click on `Scale Image` to open the `Scale Image` dialog box.
3.  The `Image Dimensions` dialog box is opened.  Change both the `X` and `Y` resolutions to that specified by the journal’s style guide – usually `300 pixels/inch`.  You can also use “Image, Scale Image” again to change the dimensions of the image once the resolution has been set.
4.  Now click on the `File` option on the menu bar, then click `Export` to save your edited image in the format specified by the journal’s style guide and in the appropriate location.
{% include figure.html img="GIMP.png" alt="GIMP software" caption="Create image using GIMP" width="100%" %}{% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Activity - Create image using GIMP" text=text %}

{% capture text %}
1.	Once downloaded and installed, open PhotoPad Image Editor.
2.	Click on `Open` on the `Home` tab, then browse to locate the image to be resized.
3.	With the image open, click on `Resolution` on the `Home` tab.
4.	Change the resolution to that specified by the journal’s style guide – usually `300 pixels/inch`.
5.	Click the `Apply` button.  You can also change the dimensions of the image once the resolution has been set.
6.	Now click on the `save` button on the `Home` tab, then click `Save As…` to save your edited image in the format specified by the journal’s style guide and in the appropriate location.{% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Activity - Create image using PhotoPad" text=text %}

{% capture text %}
1.	Go to the application folder on Mac and open “Preview”. When it is opened, click on the “File” option on the menu bar and then click on “Open…”.  Browse to locate the image to be resized.
