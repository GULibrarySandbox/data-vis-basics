# Data visualisation basics
Self-paced [online workshop](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/data-vis-basics/) developed by [Griffith University Library](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library).

Visualising data can help us understand complex information quickly.  Transforming data into a visual format can:

    reveal patterns and relationships
    identify trends 
    communicate insights with impact.

The following online demonstrations and exercises will explore methods and tools to create publication quality visualisations of structured data from spreadsheets and text from publications or documents.

This online workshop is aimed at researchers and HDR candidates and requires no coding.  

Download the software and datasets, complete the activities and watch the videos to guide you through the lessons.

Allow approximately 2 hours to complete all the activities. Note your questions and any issues for discussion at the upcoming Q&A session.
